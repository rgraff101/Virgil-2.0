### This week:
- Reviewed and studied tutorials on training the AI camera for object detection.
- Continued refining the program that dynamically adjusts the robotâ€™s operational mode based on different segments of the course.
- Successfully implemented a motor function that enables the robot to travel a specified distance based on input parameters.
- Developed and nearly completed a LiDAR program that allows the robot to move toward an object and halt upon reaching a predetermined distance.

### Goals:
- Begin the process of training the AI camera for object detection to enhance autonomous navigation capabilities.
- Organize the overall program architecture to establish a centralized main function that efficiently manages and calls sub-functions for each segment of the course.

> ### Advisor's Comments:
> Thank you for the updates.
> 1. Attaching a link of the tutorial is better.
> 2. Code udates not accessible (at least not in the [Code](./Code/) directory).
> 3. I suggest to get started with the AI kit instead of the AI camera.

### This Week:
- Researched basics on training a new model for YOLO
- https://learnopencv.com/train-yolov8-on-custom-dataset/

### Goals:
- Switch Virgil components to new base
- Start on new design with camera mount

> ### Advisor's Comments:
> Thank you for the updates.
> 1. Use one bullet if you have focused on one thing.
> 2. Any detailed plan on the new camera mount?
