## Reagan Graff
### This week:
- Reviewed and studied tutorials on training the AI camera for object detection.
- Continued refining the program that dynamically adjusts the robotâ€™s operational mode based on different segments of the course.
- Successfully implemented a motor function that enables the robot to travel a specified distance based on input parameters.
- Developed and nearly completed a LiDAR program that allows the robot to move toward an object and halt upon reaching a predetermined distance.

### Goals:
- Begin the process of training the AI camera for object detection to enhance autonomous navigation capabilities.
- Organize the overall program architecture to establish a centralized main function that efficiently manages and calls sub-functions for each segment of the course.
