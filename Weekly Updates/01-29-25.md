### This week:
- Helped Ethan with planning how the final design should look. Decided to put the battery vertically in the back and we were thinking about how rest of the parts should fit in best possible way.
- Discussed as a group with Dr.  Zhang what the best possible approach to the assignment of getting this robot around the track would be. Our goal is first to make the Lidar drive towards the bucket and then use the lidar to determine if we need to turn right or left. Planning on using the lidar for one color of buckets and then image detection for the other colors and the ramp eventually.
- Did research and found a fuse for battery (safety)
- Helped Reagan to get the program for the Lidar to work, and then program the Lidar to work together with the motors so that the motors read the data from the Lidar in order to know where we are or how far we are from the bucket.

### Goals:
- Get the program that I just talked about above to work. We need this to work in order to be able to take the next step in this. Ideally we should have ti working by next week because time goes by fast!
