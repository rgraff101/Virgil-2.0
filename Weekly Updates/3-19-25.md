### This week:
- Been working on the draft of our final report and almost done with this.

## Reagan Graff
### This Week:
- Continued refining the program.
- The robot successfully navigates to the bucket using both the camera and LiDAR. It centers the object in its view and stops when the LiDAR detects it within 1 meter. At this point, the robot transitions to Stage 2, where it navigates around the bucket using encoder-based movement.
- Implemented a dedicated detections function, which is now called at specific stages rather than running continuously.

### Goals:
- Fine-tune the first two stages to ensure precise and reliable performance.
- Once the initial stages are perfected, the later stages should be easier to implement.
- Define each stage clearly, mapping out the necessary functions so that during on-course testing, individual stages can be isolated and tested efficiently.
