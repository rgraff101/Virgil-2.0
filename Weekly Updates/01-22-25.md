### This week:
- Swapped out the old voltage divider for a  new one that sits beneath the Raspberry Pi, enabling a USB-C connection.
- Integrated the RPLidar with the Raspberry Pi 5.
- Developed and tested a program specifically for the RPLidar.
- Tidied up our workspace to keep everything in order.
- Created a new GitHub repository for this semester. 
### Goals:
- Develop a program to enable the robot to simultaneously read RPLidar distance data and move. This program will guide the robot to read the distance from a bucket using Lidar and then move until it reaches a specified distance from the bucket.
