## Reagan Graff
### This week:
- Swapped out the old voltage divider for a  new one that sits beneath the Raspberry Pi, enabling a USB-C connection.
- Integrated the RPLidar with the Raspberry Pi 5.
- Developed and tested a program specifically for the RPLidar.
- Tidied up our workspace to keep everything in order.
- Created a new GitHub repository for this semester. 
### Goals:
- Develop a program to enable the robot to simultaneously read RPLidar distance data and move. This program will guide the robot to read the distance from a bucket using Lidar and then move until it reaches a specified distance from the bucket.

- Organizing Github
- 
### Goals:
- Come back to Conway and start working with Virgil. If the lidar program doesnt work by next week, help with that, incorporate that program with the encoders so that we can read distance while driving.
- Look up measurements for the compeition maze so we can start program our encoders for the competition
